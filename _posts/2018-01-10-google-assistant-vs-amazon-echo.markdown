I've recently animated a Hands-On with my coworker on vocal assistant platforms. 
We chosed [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) and [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa), 
which appear to us as the most mature ones currently.

Here is the [step-by-step](https://github.com/xebia-france/hands-on-assistant) 
guides for both platforms to create a minimal application, deployed with serverless 
solutions.

This article provides comparisons and insights on both platforms' ways of explaining 
concepts, their tools and the whole integration process. 

# Concept

## User Says vs Utterance

# Tools
